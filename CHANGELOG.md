# Changelog

All notable changes to `venditio` will be documented in this file.

## v2.9.0 - 2026-05-19

### What's Changed

This minor release adds Laravel 13 compatibility, aligns product media storage with catalog images, and expands discount behavior with highlighted catalog flags, standalone discounts, and fixed-price discounts.

### Features

- **Catalog image backed product media** - Product image uploads now normalize into catalog image collections, including the legacy product media delete path and shared variant option media copies.
- **Highlighted catalog fields** - Renamed the catalog `in_evidence` flag to `highlighted` across products, brands, categories, and tags, including migrations, API payloads, docs, DBML, factories, tests, and Bruno requests.
- **Standalone discounts** - Replaced the previous stop-after-propagation behavior with `standalone` discounts that can be evaluated against cumulative discount stacks.
- **Fixed-price discounts** - Added `fixed_price` discount support for product-scoped discounts, including validation, resources, pipelines, factories, and request examples.

### Fixes

- Preserved Venditio’s default-locale base column sync when using the newer translatable package, keeping translated slug update responses stable.
- Avoided Laravel 13 model boot recursion in ordered tree models by assigning tree paths after inserts.
- Re-merged nested package config after Laravel 13/Testbench boot-time config overrides so partial host config continues to inherit defaults.

### Tooling

- Added Laravel 13 support to the Illuminate constraint and updated the dev stack for Orchestra Testbench 11, Pest Laravel 4.1, Collision 8.9.4, and Laravel 13-compatible Larastan.
- Updated Bruno requests for product media, highlighted catalog fields, and discount payload examples.

### Tests

- Added/updated coverage for catalog-image product media, highlighted fields, standalone and fixed-price discounts, and Laravel 13 compatibility behavior.
- Verified the package test suite against Laravel 13 with `composer test -- --colors=never`.

## v2.8.5 - 2026-05-14

### What's Changed

This patch release adds a product index exclusion filter and protects brand deletes from silently leaving products attached to deleted brands.

### Features

- **Product exclusion filter** - Added `not_ids[]` support to the product index endpoint so callers can exclude specific product IDs from list results.

### Fixes

- **Brand delete guard** - Deleting a brand with connected products now returns a validation error unless `force=1` is provided; forced deletes detach products from the brand and clear brand tag associations before soft deleting the brand.

### Tooling

- **Bruno product list example** - Updated the product list Bruno request to document and exercise the `not_ids[]` filter.

### Tests

- Added feature coverage for `not_ids[]` filtering and validation, plus guarded and forced brand deletion behavior.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.8.4...v2.8.5

## v2.8.4 - 2026-05-13

### What's Changed

This patch release makes list and tree ordering deterministic across API responses, with branch-scoped ordering for product categories and tags plus clearer request examples for default sort behavior.

### Features

- **Branch-scoped tree ordering** - Product categories and tags now order children and descendants by `sort_order` within each sibling branch, with primary keys used as deterministic tie-breakers.
- **Default list ordering** - List endpoints now apply a default order when no explicit sort is requested, using `sort_order` where available and newest IDs first otherwise.

### Fixes

- **Bulk tree update response ordering** - Bulk product category and tag updates now return refreshed records in their persisted default order after parent or sort changes are applied.
- **Tree sort order validation** - Product category and tag create, update, and bulk update payloads now require `sort_order` values to start at `1`, matching branch-scoped numbering semantics.

### Tooling

- **Bruno list examples** - Updated Bruno list requests to use deterministic default sort examples and documented branch-scoped tree ordering for category and tag requests.

### Tests

- Added feature coverage for default list ordering, tree branch ordering at multiple depths, `sort_order` validation, and bulk tree update response ordering.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.8.3...v2.8.4

## v2.8.3 - 2026-05-11

### What's Changed

This patch release improves product category and tag tree deletion behavior by preserving descendant structure by default while adding an explicit recursive deletion option for host applications.

### Features

- **Recursive tree deletion controls** - Added `delete_children` support to product category and tag delete endpoints so callers can recursively delete a node and every descendant when requested.

### Fixes

- **Tree child promotion on delete** - Deleting a product category or tag now moves direct children to the deleted node's parent and rebuilds descendant paths instead of always releasing children to the root.
- **Subtree product association checks** - Recursive product category and tag deletes now require `force=1` when any affected descendant is connected to products and clear related pivots for the deleted subtree when forced.

### Tooling

- **Tree delete documentation** - Updated the API reference and Bruno delete requests to document `delete_children`, `force`, and default child promotion behavior.

### Tests

- Added feature coverage for default child promotion, recursive category/tag deletion, forced subtree association cleanup, and Venditio nested config merge behavior.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.8.2...v2.8.3

## v2.8.2 - 2026-05-11

### What's Changed

This patch release makes the package migration publishing list complete again so host applications receive every Venditio migration when publishing package assets.

### Fixes

- **Migration publishing completeness** - Added the missing product collection metadata, related products, inventory stock management, and catalog image collection migrations to the service provider publish list.

### Tests

- Added feature coverage that compares every package migration file against the `venditio-migrations` publish group.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.8.1...v2.8.2

## v2.8.1 - 2026-05-11

### What's Changed

This patch release preserves nullable country seed fields during the Venditio data migration and adds release-publisher workflow metadata for repository-local agent and Cursor usage.

### Fixes

- **Country seed nullable fields** - Stopped filtering empty values out of seeded country rows so nullable fields such as `capital` are preserved as empty strings during the Venditio data migration.

### Tooling

- **Release publisher workflow metadata** - Added repository-local release-publisher skill, agent metadata, and Cursor rule files for consistent semantic release publishing.

### Tests

- Added feature coverage for the Venditio data migration country seeding behavior, including nullable seeded fields.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.8.0...v2.8.1

## v2.8.0 - 2026-05-07

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Related products API** - Added related-product management for products, including storage, validation, resource output, API docs, DBML schema coverage, Bruno requests, and feature tests.
- **Price-list discount eligibility** - Added `allow_discounts` to price lists and resolved pricing snapshots so host apps can exclude protected price-list prices from automatic line discounts and cart/order total discount-code calculations.
- **Price-list price product includes** - Added `include=product` support on price-list price list, show, store, update, and bulk upsert responses.

#### Fixes

- **Cart product resolution with host scopes** - Cart line product lookup now bypasses host global scopes while reapplying package-level purchasability constraints, allowing unmanaged zero-stock products to be purchased when inventory stock management is disabled.
- **Tree path rebuilding** - Product category and tag bulk updates and deletes now rebuild descendant paths when nodes move or children are released to the root.

#### API & Tooling

- **Docs, schema, and Bruno examples** - Updated the API reference, DBML schema, and Bruno collection for related products, price-list discount eligibility, and price-list price product includes.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for related products, price-list discount opt-outs, price-list price product includes, cart product resolution with host scopes, and tree path rebuilding for categories and tags.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.7.0...v2.8.0

## v2.7.0 - 2026-04-30

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Wishlist API** - Added full wishlist support with `GET /wishlists`, `GET /wishlists/{wishlist}`, `POST /wishlists`, `PATCH /wishlists/{wishlist}`, and `DELETE /wishlists/{wishlist}`, plus item-level endpoints to add, update, and remove wishlist products. Wishlists are user-owned, support `product_ids` sync semantics, optional metadata, `include=user,items,items.product,products,products_count`, `user_id` filtering, default-list enforcement per user, and dedicated wishlist lifecycle events.
- **Bulk tag updates** - Added `PATCH /tags/bulk/update` so host apps can reorder tag trees and update `parent_id` / `sort_order` for multiple tags in one request.
- **Expanded tag associations** - Tag create/update payloads now accept `product_ids`, `brand_ids`, `product_category_ids`, `product_collection_ids`, and `tag_ids`, with matching includes for `products`, `brands`, `product_categories`, `product_collections`, and `tags`. Product-type compatibility is enforced when attaching products to a typed tag.

#### Fixes

- **SEO metadata normalization and validation** - Brand, product, product category, product collection, and tag write requests now normalize empty-string SEO metadata values to `null` and validate the supported metadata keys consistently before persistence.
- **Product ids filter rollback** - Removed the temporary `ids[]` filter path from product index and product export handling so the supported API surface matches the documented filters.

#### API & Tooling

- **Docs, config, and Bruno examples** - Expanded the API reference, DBML schema, configuration, and Bruno requests to document the new wishlist surface, bulk tag update endpoint, expanded tag association payloads/includes, and the supported SEO metadata shape for catalog resources and products.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for wishlist CRUD/item flows and policy gating, bulk tag updates, expanded tag associations and includes, product-type compatibility checks for tagged products, and SEO metadata normalization/validation.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.6.1...v2.7.0

## v2.6.1 - 2026-04-30

### What's Changed

#### Fixes

- **SEO metadata normalization across catalog writes** - Brand, product, product category, product collection, and tag write requests now normalize empty-string `metadata` values to `null` before validation and persistence, keeping SEO-style metadata payloads consistent across update flows.
- **SEO metadata field validation** - Catalog and product metadata payloads now validate the supported SEO fields such as `titolo`, `descrizione`, `open_graph_*`, and `twitter_*`, so invalid nested metadata shapes are rejected consistently instead of being stored unchecked.
- **Product ids filter rollback** - Removed the temporary `ids[]` filter path from product index and product export handling so the supported API surface matches the documented filters.

#### API & Tooling

- **Docs and Bruno metadata examples** - Updated the API reference and Bruno create/update requests for brands, product categories, product collections, products, and tags to show the supported SEO metadata shape. The docs no longer advertise `ids[]` as a supported `/products` filter.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for metadata normalization and SEO metadata validation across catalog resources and products, plus regression coverage for full product collection updates that persist normalized metadata payloads.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.6.0...v2.6.1

## v2.6.0 - 2026-04-29

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Product collection metadata, tags, and counts** - Product collections now persist a nullable `metadata` JSON payload, accept `tag_ids` in create and update requests with sync semantics, allow `tag_ids[]` filtering on the index endpoint, expose `include=tags`, and support `include=products_count` on index, show, store, and update responses.
- **Catalog product-count includes** - Brands and product categories now support `include=products_count`.

#### API & Tooling

- **Docs and Bruno examples** - Expanded the API reference and Bruno requests to document product collection metadata and tag payloads and `products_count` includes on catalog resources. The docs now also call out `tag_ids` write payload support where it already existed on related catalog resources.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for product collection metadata persistence, tag syncing, and product-count includes on brands/categories/collections.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.5.0...v2.6.0

## v2.5.0 - 2026-04-28

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Catalog image delete endpoints** - Added dedicated `DELETE /brands/{brand}/images/{imageId}`, `DELETE /product_categories/{productCategory}/images/{imageId}`, `DELETE /product_collections/{productCollection}/images/{imageId}`, and `DELETE /tags/{tag}/images/{imageId}` endpoints so host apps can remove individual catalog image entries without resubmitting the full resource payload. Deleted files are removed from the public disk by default and now honor the configurable `VENDITIO_CATALOG_IMAGE_DELETE_FILES_FROM_FILESYSTEM` toggle, while shared file paths are preserved when another catalog resource still references them.

#### Fixes

- **Typed catalog image replacement flow** - Catalog image updates now allow a request to promote a generic image into the `thumb` or `cover` slot when the existing typed image is released in the same `images` payload, avoiding false validation conflicts during slot reassignment.
- **Scoped variant-option images on product payloads** - Product `variants_options_table.values[].images` responses now include only the shared variant-option media that belongs to the requested product, preventing sibling products from leaking their option images into each other's payloads.

#### API & Tooling

- **Bruno catalog image coverage** - Added Bruno requests for the new catalog image delete endpoints and documented the typed-image replacement rule plus the product-scoped variant-option media behavior in the existing request examples.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for catalog image deletion across all catalog owners, filesystem retention rules, typed image slot reassignment, and product-scoped variant option images.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.4.0...v2.5.0

## v2.4.0 - 2026-04-27

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Parent variant set on variant product show responses** - `GET /products/{product}?include=variants` now loads the sibling variant set under `parent.variants` when the requested product is itself a variant, so host apps can retrieve the full variant family from a variant detail request without a follow-up parent fetch.

#### API & Tooling

- **Product show docs and Bruno example** - Documented the variant-product `include=variants` behavior in the API reference and Bruno product show request.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage to ensure variant product show responses expose the full parent variant set when `include=variants` is requested.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0

## v2.3.0 - 2026-04-23

### What's Changed

#### Breaking Changes

- **Tag image payloads** - Tags now use the shared `images` collection instead of the legacy `img_thumb` / `img_cover` fields. A dedicated migration converts existing tag images into collection items and preserves rollback support for the old columns.

#### Features

- **Separated discount includes across discountable APIs** - Discountable resources now accept `include=discounts,valid_discounts,expired_discounts`, exposing all non-deleted discounts plus filtered current and expired subsets on products, brands, product categories, product collections, product types, tags, carts, cart lines, orders, and order lines. Product responses also propagate the same split discount relations to nested variants when included.
- **Shared catalog image galleries** - Brand, product category, product collection, and tag image payloads now support repeated generic gallery items with `type=null` while still enforcing unique `thumb` and `cover` slots through the shared catalog image merge and validation flow.

#### Fixes

- **Discount start-date fallback** - Updating a discount with `starts_at=null` now resets the value to the current timestamp instead of leaving the previous start date in place.

#### API & Tooling

- **Docs and Bruno examples** - Expanded the API reference and Bruno requests to document the new discount include variants, the tag endpoints, and the catalog `images` payload shape for tags and other catalog image owners.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for separated discount includes on show and index endpoints, tag image collection validation and persistence, multi-image gallery payloads, and the discount `starts_at` fallback on update.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0

## v2.2.0 - 2026-04-21

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Discount list filters** - Added `is_general` filtering for general versus scoped discounts and exact `discountable_type` filtering with package morph alias normalization on the discount index endpoint.
- **Country tax class pivot payloads** - Country and tax class relationship includes now expose the country-tax-class pivot resource so consumers can read pivot values such as tax rates from included country payloads.

#### API & Tooling

- **Docs and Bruno examples** - Documented the new discount list filters in the API reference and added Bruno requests for listing general discounts and filtering discounts by discountable type.
- **Manual CI triggers** - Changed the test and PHP style GitHub Actions workflows to run only through manual dispatch instead of automatically on push or pull request events.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for general discount filtering, exact discountable type filtering, and country-tax-class pivot serialization on tax class includes.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0

## v2.1.0 - 2026-04-15

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Shipping domain and cart fee calculation** - Added CRUD APIs for `shipping_methods`, `shipping_zones`, and `shipping_method_zones`, plus configurable flat or zone-based shipping calculation with volumetric-weight support and shipping snapshots on carts and orders.
- **Promotions and collections** - Added product collections, free gift management, cart free-gift decisions, and the new `first_purchase_only` discount rule so host apps can model broader merchandising flows through stable APIs.
- **Returns workflow** - Added `return_reasons` and `return_requests` APIs with nested line validation, derived return state on order lines, and immutability rules once follow-up crediting begins.
- **Invoices and credit notes** - Added optional order-scoped invoice and credit note generation with persisted snapshots, swappable numbering/payload/template/PDF contracts, and PDF download endpoints for issued documents.

#### Fixes

- **Document seller fallback** - Generated invoices and credit notes now read seller company data from the settings table when configured there, keeping issued documents aligned with host-app business identity settings.

#### API & Tooling

- **Docs and examples** - Expanded the README, API reference, architecture notes, and Bruno collections to document shipping, returns, invoices, credit notes, product collections, and the widened discountable surface.

#### Tests

- Added broad feature and unit coverage for shipping flows, free gifts, returns, invoices, credit notes, product collections, enriched cart behavior, and the default document templates.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.0.3...v2.1.0

## v2.0.3 - 2026-03-17

### What's Changed

#### Fixes

- **Case-insensitive text filters** - String query filters on list endpoints now use case-insensitive partial matching (`LIKE %value%`) instead of exact matches, while non-string filters keep their existing exact behavior.

#### API & Tooling

- **API filter docs** - Documented the updated string-filter behavior in the API reference so host apps can rely on the new list query semantics.

#### Tests

- Added regression coverage for case-insensitive partial matching on string list filters.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.0.2...v2.0.3

## v2.0.2 - 2026-03-16

### What's Changed

#### Fixes

- **Catalog image sort ordering** - Brand and product category `images` collections now validate, persist, and return `sort_order`, while updates keep existing image ids stable when metadata changes without a new upload.
- **Product category ordering regression coverage** - Added regression coverage for root category index ordering by `sort_order`, alongside save/update coverage for ordered brand and category image collections.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for brand/category image `sort_order` persistence and metadata-only updates, plus root product category index ordering.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.0.1...v2.0.2

## v2.0.1 - 2026-03-16

### What's Changed

#### Breaking Changes

- **Variant option image field removal** - `product_variant_options.image` has been removed from the schema, validation rules, filters, factories, and request examples. A follow-up migration drops the legacy column for existing installs.

#### Features

- **Shared variant option images** - Product variant option responses and `variants_options_table` entries now expose an `images` collection derived from media uploaded through the shared variant-option upload endpoint for that specific option.

#### API & Tooling

- **Bruno and schema docs** - Updated variant option request examples and filter metadata to remove the legacy `image` field from the documented public surface.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for shared variant option images on both the variant option endpoint and the product `variants_options_table` response.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1

## v2.0.0 - 2026-03-13

### What's Changed

#### Breaking Changes

- **Catalog image payloads for brands and product categories** - Brand and product category APIs now use a typed `images` collection with `thumb` / `cover` items instead of separate `img_thumb` and `img_cover` fields. A dedicated migration converts legacy stored values to the new structure and keeps rollback support for the old columns.

#### Features

- **Brand catalog metadata and address PEC/SDI fields** - Brands now expose catalog-oriented fields such as abstract, description, metadata, visibility flags, and ordering, while addresses support `sdi` and `pec` fields across validation, filters, resources, and request examples.
- **Inventory reorder metadata** - Inventories and nested product inventory payloads now support nullable `minimum_reorder_quantity` and `reorder_lead_days` fields, and product exports can include the same reorder planning columns.

#### Fixes

- **Tax-inclusive pricing defaults** - Inventory- and price-list-based pricing now default to tax-inclusive values consistently across migrations, factories, seeded data, pricing resolution, and cart/order tax pipelines when `price_includes_tax` is missing.
- **Migration column ordering** - Follow-up migration updates keep `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at` as the trailing columns after schema upgrades that add address, inventory, brand, or product-category fields.

#### API & Tooling

- **Bruno** - Updated the brand, product category, inventory, product, and price-list-price request examples to reflect the new public payload shapes and defaults.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for typed brand and product category image collections, inventory reorder fields on both inventory and product APIs, and product export columns for reorder metadata.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v1.6.2...v2.0.0

## v1.6.2 - 2026-03-12

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Discount includes on discountable resources** - Added `include=discounts` support to the product, brand, product category, and product type APIs so headless admin clients can fetch scoped discounts alongside those resources on both show and index responses.

#### Tests

- Added feature coverage for `include=discounts` across the supported discountable resource endpoints.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v1.6.1...v1.6.2

## v1.6.1 - 2026-03-12

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Discounts bulk upsert** - Added `POST /discounts/bulk/upsert` so host apps can update existing discounts by `id` and create new discounts in the same request, with automatic code generation for discountable-scoped creates when no code is supplied.

#### API & Tooling

- **Bruno** - Added the bulk discount upsert request example for admin and QA workflows.

#### Tests

- Extended discount API coverage for mixed create/update bulk upserts and payload validation around duplicate ids and duplicate codes.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio-core/compare/v1.6.0...v1.6.1

## v1.6.0 - 2026-03-12

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Discount origin metadata in product price breakdowns** - `include=price_breakdown` product responses now expose `discountable_type` and `discountable_id` for each applied automatic discount, making it easier for admin UIs to show where every propagated discount comes from.

#### Tests

- Extended product pricing breakdown assertions and reran the discount pipeline coverage for the enriched applied-discount snapshot.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0

## v1.5.0 - 2026-03-12

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Product price breakdown preview** - Added `include=price_breakdown` on product payloads so admin and headless clients can inspect the resolved base price source together with the ordered list of automatic discounts applied to the product preview.

#### Fixes

- **Grouped ordering for catalog definitions** - The shared `Ordered` scope now respects grouping keys before `sort_order`, keeping product custom fields ordered within each product type, variants within each product type, and variant options within each variant.
- **Category tree rebuild ordering** - Bulk category updates now preserve the expected `sort_order` when rebuilding tree responses.
- **Product custom field options casting** - Product custom field `options` are now consistently serialized as JSON in the public API.

#### API & Tooling

- **Bruno** - Updated the product show request example to document the new `price_breakdown` include.
- **Docs** - Documented `price_breakdown` in the API reference.

#### Tests

- Extended feature coverage for product pricing breakdown previews, grouped ordering of product custom fields / variants / variant options, category tree rebuild ordering, and cart tax calculation when a billing address is added before checkout.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio-core/compare/v1.4.0...v1.5.0

## v1.4.0 - 2026-03-11

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Inventory stock management toggle** - Added `manage_stock` support on inventories and product payloads so host apps can choose when stock should actually be reserved and committed. A dedicated migration adds the new column and stock pipelines now skip reservations for non-managed inventory.
- **Country tax classes bulk upsert** - Added `POST /country_tax_classes/bulk/upsert` to create or update country tax rates by the natural key `country_id + tax_class_id`, with tuple-level validation and policy checks.
- **Header-driven product tax resolution** - Product responses can now resolve tax calculations from the `Country-ISO-2` request header, allowing headless storefronts to preview localized tax totals without changing the product resource contract.

#### Fixes

- **Datetime casts** - Standardized datetime casting on catalog and commerce models so timestamp serialization is consistent across the API surface.
- **Country tax class uniqueness** - `country_tax_classes` create and update validation now reject duplicate `country_id + tax_class_id` combinations to keep tax-rate resolution deterministic.

#### API & Tooling

- **Bruno** - Added the new country tax class bulk upsert request, corrected the country tax class CRUD examples, and introduced the `Country-ISO-2` environment/header setup for product requests.
- **Docs** - Updated the API reference with the new bulk upsert endpoint.

#### Tests

- Extended feature coverage for stock reservation behavior with `manage_stock`, country tax class bulk upsert and uniqueness validation, localized product tax calculation, cart/order tax flows, and discount scenarios affected by country tax resolution.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0

## v1.3.0 - 2026-03-10

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Product media metadata** - Product images and files now support stable backend-generated ids, `mimetype`, `sort_order`, `active`, and shared-media flags; images also support `thumbnail`. Media updates can modify metadata without re-uploading the underlying file.
- **Product media lifecycle** - Product media uploads append to the existing collection instead of replacing it, and products now expose dedicated media deletion by unique id with configurable filesystem cleanup.
- **Variant option shared media** - Added `POST /product/{product}/{productVariantOption}/upload` to upload media once for a variant option and propagate it to all matching variant products, storing assets under `products/{product_id}/variant_options/{variant_option_id}/...`.
- **Shared media semantics** - Variant-option media is marked with `shared_from_variant_option` and returned after variant-specific media in product API responses, making color-level galleries reusable across size variants without duplicating uploads.

#### API & Tooling

- **Bruno** - Added Bruno requests for product media deletion and variant-option media upload, and updated the product update request documentation for the expanded media payload fields.
- **Configuration** - Added `VENDITIO_PRODUCT_MEDIA_DELETE_FILES_FROM_FILESYSTEM` to let host apps decide whether filesystem assets should be removed when product media is deleted.

#### Tests

- Extended feature coverage for product media append/update/delete flows, media ordering and active filtering, shared variant-option media propagation, and shared-file deletion safety.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v1.2.5...v1.3.0

## v1.2.5 - 2026-03-10

### What's Changed

#### Fixes

- **API filters and global scopes** - Explicit list filters now override matching implicit global scopes in the shared API filter pipeline. Product `status` filters correctly return draft products, and explicit `active` / date-window filters no longer get masked by default active or visibility scopes.

#### Tests

- Added regression coverage for explicit `status`, `active`, and date-range filters against scoped endpoints.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v1.2.4...v1.2.5

## v1.2.4 - 2026-03-09

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Translatable dependency range** - Relaxed the `pictastudio/translatable` Composer constraint from `^0.1` to `^0` so the package can install against the broader set of compatible stable `0.x` releases.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v1.2.3...v1.2.4

## v1.2.3 - 2026-03-09

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Recursive config merge** - The service provider now merges package and application `venditio` config recursively during registration, preserving nested defaults while allowing host apps to override only the keys they need.

#### API & Tooling

- **Bruno locale header** - Added the `Locale` header to Bruno requests across the catalog endpoints and introduced a default `locale` environment variable for localized API testing.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pictastudio/venditio/compare/v1.2.2...v1.2.3

## v1.2.1 - 2026-03-05

### What's Changed

#### Features

- **Price list prices bulk upsert** - Added `POST /price_list_prices/bulk/upsert` to create or update multiple prices across multiple products and price lists in a single request, using the natural key `product_id + price_list_id`.
- **Default price normalization in bulk flows** - Bulk upsert now enforces a single `is_default=true` price per product after persistence, keeping pricing resolution deterministic.
- **Validation for bulk payloads** - Added dedicated bulk request validation for `price_list_prices` with checks for required nested fields, duplicate `(product_id, price_list_id)` tuples in the same payload, and conflicting multiple defaults per product.
- **Authorization behavior** - Bulk endpoint applies policy checks per target row: `update` for existing tuples and `create` when new tuples are introduced.
- **Soft-deleted tuple handling** - Bulk upsert restores soft-deleted `price_list_prices` rows when matching tuples are re-submitted.

#### API & Tooling

- **Routes** - Registered `price_list_prices.upsertMultiple` route.
- **Bruno** - Added request collection entry for bulk upsert (`bruno/venditio/price_list_prices/07_bulk_upsert.bru`).
- **Docs** - Updated API reference with the new bulk endpoint.

#### Tests

- Extended `PriceListApiTest` coverage for:
  - successful multi-product/multi-price-list bulk upsert
  - default flag normalization behavior
  - validation errors for duplicate tuples and multiple defaults per product
